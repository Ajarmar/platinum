# Rockman Zero 2 Platinum (cutscene skip hack)

# This hack is currently in pre-release. See [the release page](https://github.com/Ajarmar/platinum/releases/tag/v1.0-beta) for more information.

This hack is meant to put Zero 2 more in line with Zero 3 and Zero 4. The kinds of cutscenes that typically are skippable in those games have been made to be skippable in this game. This includes:

- Most stage start cutscenes
- Most pre-boss cutscenes
- Post-boss cutscenes that aren't just regular explosions
- Some mid-stage cutscenes
- Most Resistance Base cutscenes

The following kinds of cutscenes are **not** skippable:

- Stage start cutscenes without any text boxes
- Pre-boss cutscenes without any text boxes
- Midboss cutscenes (except for Ciel cutscenes in Kuwagust's stage)
- Cutscenes where Zero's position *after* the cutscene can vary significantly cannot be skipped (for example, when speaking to Elpizo and Cerveau at the start).

Some more information:

- Skipping a cutscene will not change the RNG value. However, you might find that bosses will behave differently than what you are used to if you skip their cutscenes, since RNG sometimes changes during cutscenes.

## Working as intended

The following things are working as intended.

- Cutscenes with text box prompts can only be skipped until the point where the set of text boxes with the prompt appears (for example, Ciel cutscene at the start).
- Panter/Harpuia mid-stage cutscenes cannot be skipped.
- Boss cutscenes look different between initial fights and final stage refights.
- Skipping the cutscene before Elpizo 1 will spawn you to the left of Elpizo, even if you zip into the room.
