# Changelog

## 2021-10-28: v1.0

- Changed game start sound effect to **Phoenix Magnion's "Moero"**
    - This acts as a version signifier; it will be changed again for any future releases.
- Fixed active Cyber Elves being removed when skipping a cutscene.
- Updated Zero's position after skipping the Harpuia pre-boss cutscene to match his position after the cutscene that plays the first time you enter the boss fight, instead of his position after the cutscene that plays on subsequent encounters.
    - The effect of this is that you spawn slightly further away from Harpuia.
- Added small delays before the following cutscenes:
    - Elpizo is introduced (Commander Room after Intro stage)
    - Zero brings Elpizo back to the Resistance Base and then leaves (Commander Room after Neo Arcadia 1)
- Updated the windows for skipping cutscenes to be more like Zero 3/Zero 4.
    - Pre-boss cutscenes are now skippable at the earliest when Zero has fully passed through the door (*if there is a door* - otherwise it is still when you lose control of Zero), and at the latest when the "WARNING" graphic appears.
    - For most other cutscenes, the latest point where you can skip a cutscene is set to be the point that you skip to if you skip it.
- It is now possible to skip the ending cutscene and credits (but not the Omega foreshadowing cutscene).
- Hard mode can now be played without needing to beat the game first.
- Fixed a bug where if you soft reset while skipping a cutscene and then selected "New Game", your starting health in that new game would be the same as your health before the soft reset.

## 2021-01-23: v1.0-beta (pre-release)

- Initial release.
